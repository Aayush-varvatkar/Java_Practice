OOPS Concept...

1. Encapsulation
       > To make sure that sensitive data is hidden from the user 
       To achive this, declare class variables/attributes as "private"

2.  Inheritance
       > The attributes and methods of one class can be inherited by another class
       use the extends keyword.

3. Abstraction 
       > the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
        can be achieved with either    "abstract classes"  or  "interfaces"

4. Polymorphism
       > Achieved by overriding a method in a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. (Inheritance), Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
       This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
