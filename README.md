# Java_Practice
In this repository, there's a detailed java language course


> only one public class in single java file 


> Four Levels of Access:

1. public:      Accessible everywhere.
2. protected:   Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
3. default:     Accessible within the same package.
4. private:     Accessible only within the same class.


> Objects must be created using 'NEW' Keyword

> Overloading :   When two or more classes have same names but different parameters ( in a single file )
          used when-    You need multiple variations of a method to handle different inputs.

> Overriding :    Occus when a subclass provides its own implementation of method that is already defined in it's superclass
          used when-    You need to provide a specific behavior for a method in a subclass.



> This keyword :
1. To access instance variables
   differentiate between instance variables and method/constructor parameters if they have the same name.
2. to call the another method in the current metgod / or constructor

> Super Keyword : 
1. To access super class variable 
   differentiate between instance variables and method/constructor parameters if they have the same name.
2. Invoke Superclass Methods:
   Used to call a method from the superclass / 'another class' that is overridden in the subclass. / or constructor
